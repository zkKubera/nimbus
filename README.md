# NIMBUS

The idea behind Nimbus is to allow user to mint dynamic avatars as NFTs 👾 Which they can customise all they want (even after minting ✨) and use them as PFPs on social or anywhere else that they would use a regular NFT.

Nimbus gives you the freedom to mint an avatar just once and keep on customising it later as per your mood XD

Currently Nimbus is live on Mantle, Polygon Mumbai 🚀

It is built using [scaffold-eth 2 🏗️](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2)
